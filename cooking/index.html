      <p>A record of the meals my wife Kate and I have cooked together for Friday Night Dinner.</p>
      <hr>
		<h3>BBQ Winter Ribs + Big Herby Potato Wedges</h3>
		<p>Very simple to make, but requires patience. Ribs need 2 hours at 120c first, and than an hour of 10 min intervals at 160c adding layers of BBQ sauce every 10 mins.<br>
			Meat was gorgeous. Sauce was a little bland (we used Heinz). Would like to use a thinner sauce/some way for the sauce to get deeper into the meat.</p>
		<h3>Creamy Chicken & Chorizo Pasta w/ Garlic Doughknots</h3>
		<p>Pasta dish was quite similar to Kate's Cajun Chicken Pasta, but a thinner consistency. Made with double cream and made thicker with helpings of grated parmesan.</p>
		<h3>Homemade McDonald's - Big Mac for Tom, Plain Double Cheeseburger for Kate; Chicken Nuggets; Large Fries</h3>
		<p>Unbelieveable how similar everything was, from the Big Mac sauce to the size and texture of the fries. Very time consuming. Definitely a one-off.
			Chicken Nuggets were made too big, and we didn't grind the chicken mince enough, so they had a meaty texture which was the only missed note.<br>
			Surprised how easy it was to create smashed burgers, and will be making those as a quick dinner in the future!</p>
		<h3>Breakfast Pork Chops with Fried Egg, Potato Rostis, and Sauteed spinach with Garlic</h3>

		<h3>Chicken Carbonara, Homemade Garlic Bread, and Grilled Broccoli</h3>
